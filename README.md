# Life-long-learning-

This repository contains some simulations of an exciting deep learning paradigm, i.e., lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is a well-known problem where training
classifiers from incremental data streams, e.g., using stochastic gradient descent optimization, will cause the classification accuracy to deteriorate quickly,
an effect known in the literature as catastrophic forgetting. The repository has simulations for the task and class incremental learning with knowledge distillation and transfer learning. These techniques have proven to be efficient in learning different tasks incrementally.
